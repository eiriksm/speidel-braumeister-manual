## Notes on the container lid {#notes-on-the-container-lid}

The lid assists in reaching the temperatures more quickly in the heating up phase. The ventilation slits avoid pressure forming in the vessel and allow for a light air circulation. Higher water temperatures cause condensation to occur on the underside of the lid. When lifting the lid, ensure that you hold the lid rim over the vessel opening (at an angle) so that the condensation can run back into the vessel.
