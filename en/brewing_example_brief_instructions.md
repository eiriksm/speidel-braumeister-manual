# Brewing example/ brief instructions {#brewing-example-brief-instructions}

The following example serves to illustrate your first brewing procedure with the Braumeister on a step-by-step basis using an actual recipe:

Beer type: Wheat beer/ top-fermented

Beer quantity: 10 L/20 L/ 50 L ready-to-drink beer

Original wort: 11-12°Plato

Ingredients:

*   2.5/4.5/10 kg **roughly** crushed brewing malt (50% wheat malt, 50% barley malt, and a touch of caramel malt where required)
*   15 L/30 L/60 L medium-hard brewing water or tap water (12 L/23 L/55 L to start off with and the remainder for topping up)
*   15 g/ 30 g/ 75 g hops with 4% alpha acid (approx. 2/3 immediately after start of boiling and approx. 1/3 a few minutes before end of boiling)
*   Top-fermented dry yeast

Procure ingredients according to above indications.

Clean the Braumeister and place securely in brewing location.

Also clean all additional equipment required, such as malt shovel, wooden spoon, wort hydrometer, cooling coil, fermentation vessel including accessories etc, and have readily accessible.

Programming the recipe – press _Recipe_ button. While in the programming mode, you can set the times, temperatures, and hops batches depending on the recipe A suitable standard recipe is already stored. After confirming all inputs and pressing the _Select_ button, the recipe will be stored. Go back by pressing _Abbort_ and start the Automatic mode by selecting the desired recipe in the _Brewstart_ menu. The Braumeister guides you through the following brewing procedure.

Add 12 L/ 23 L/ 55 L brewing water – for 20 L to approx. 2 cm below the upper marking on the tie rod or filling level indicator.

Follow the instructions of the brew control by pressing _Select_, acknowledging that water has been added. Venting of the pump takes place automatically, followed by heating up to the programmed mashing-in temperature.

When the mashing-in temperature has been reached, a signal tone is emitted; press _Select_ to acknowledge it. Then insert the malt pipe (with pulled-on seal facing downwards). Ensure that the seal is centred on the malt pipe and sits absolutely flush on the vessel base. Slide in the filter plate to the lower edge (pipe facing up). Then insert the fine sieve (position at bottom of water).

Pour 2.5/ 4.5/ 10 kg malt into the malt pipe. Ensure that no malt is spilled, as this could block the pump.

Mix the malt in thoroughly using a wooden spoon and allow to swell for a few minutes. Then slide the second fine sieve onto the malt followed by the second filter plate (pipe facing up again). Position the hold-down bow and tighten well using the wing nut.

Press the _Select_ button to continuethe Automatic mode. Lightly coloured brewing water rises up and spills over. The cycle has begun. The next brewing phases take place fully automatically, as programmed. During some of the brewing phases, the control causes a short pump break to reposition the malt. The display shows the actual and the target temperatures as well as the target and actual run time for each phase.

After the brew phases are completed, as signal is sounded again. Press the _Select_ button to acknowledge it. Remove the wing nut and hold-down bow. All parts are extremely hot. Therefore, the use of kitchen gloves is highly recommended. Rest the hold-down bow on the vessel. Pull out the malt pipe using both hands and suspend from the lower bolts in the hold-down bow. Allow the malt to drain. Use the wooden spoon to pierce the malt several times to allow the beer wort to drain more effectively. Remove the malt pipe with the malt completely after 15-20 minutes.

Continue by pressing the _Select_ button in order to start the hops boiling process. Do not close the lid. Avoid the hops boiling over. Add the first hops batches of 10 g / 20 g/ 50 g 10 min after the boiling process has started. Do not close the lid during the hops boiling process either. Steam must be able to escape. Top up evaporated water quantity or adjust original wort. Add the last batch of hops 10 min before end of boiling.

Raise cold wort to room temperature and carefully pour into fermentation vessel, 1 hour before decanting. First remove a little foam from the top using a ladle. Do not move the vessel again before decanting. Fill into bottles, kegs or maturation vessels (accessory) using a pipe. Do not fill bottles more than 90-95%. Allow bottles to stand at even temperature for 1-2 days and ventilate briefly on a daily basis (only in case of excess pressure). Then allow the beer to mature a further 3-4 weeks at a temperature of 10-15°C.

Cheers!
