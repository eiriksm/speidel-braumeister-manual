# Cleaning instructions {#cleaning-instructions}

Fill with approx. 2 cm water above the heating coil and heat to ~ 35°C by means of manual control. Caution: Vent the pump by switching it on and off several times!

Then disconnect the Braumeister from the mains again.

You can now remove all brewing remnants from the inside of the container and the heating coil using a brush, ideally after each brew.

Basic cleaning also includes cleaning of the suction and pressure openings.

After cleaning the heating coil, inner wall of the container, and the suction and pressure openings, empty the Braumeister and rinse the entire container once more.

Next, the pump must be cleaned. Open the pump.

You should be able to open the pump housing by hand. If this is not the case, please loosen the housing via the screw-cap using a small square of timber and a hammer.

Now, the rotor ball in the interior of the pump becomes visible.

Caution:

The rotor ball may fall out! This may results in the failure of the pump at a later stage!

Remove the rotor ball from the housing for cleaning. Any brewing remnants must be carefully removed so as not to block the bores.

The pump housing should also be cleaned. Then place the clean rotor ball back into the housing.

**Finally, tighten the screw pump again – by hand only.**
