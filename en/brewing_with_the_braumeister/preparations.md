## Preparations {#preparations}

Procuring the ingredients

Organise the required brewing ingredients (hops, malt and yeast) in good time. Ensure that the malt is fresh. After crushing the malt (breaking open the corns – not too fine) use it up as quickly as possible. The quantities vary slightly, depending on the recipe. However, the amount of malt is 2-2.5/4-5/ 9-11 kg and the amount of hops is about 15-40/ 20-80/ 50-150 g. Normally, the hops is supplied in a pressed form as pellets. We recommend using dry yeast for fermentation as it can be stored more easily and has a longer shelf life. These ingredients are available at commercial outlets for hobby brewers and via the internet.

Cleaning the devices

Before starting the brewing process, rinse the Braumeister with warm water and flush the pump by switching it on. All other equipment such as the beer spindle, wooden spoon and fermentation vessel should be ready for use and clean. See also the notes in the chapters “Notes on hygiene” and “Cleaning the Braumeister” in this regard.

Decalcifying the water for brewing

Where required, the brewing water can be decalcified. For this, boil the water (cold tap water) in the Braumeister for 30 minutes, allow it to cool and then store it temporarily, for example in the fermentation vessel, until you are ready to start brewing. Dispose of the precipitated calcium that has collected at the bottom of the container. The Braumeister is designed to brew approx. 10 L/20 L/ 50 L ready-to-drink beer (regular beer). You will need 15-20 L/25-30 L/55-60 L brewing water. However, normal (perfectly hygienic, colourless and odourless) cold tap water can also be used by beginners, that is, for first brewing attempts, to keep the effort slightly in check to start off with. In principle, the brewing water should display a hardness less than 14°dH. The softer the water, the better it is suited to brewing.
