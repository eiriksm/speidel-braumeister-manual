## Introduction {#introduction}

Making beer with the Braumeister can be split into different phases, whereby each phase is individually described below. To start off, all phases are described in general: The brewing procedure applies to all beer types and recipes. An actual brewing example for first-time brewers and a special recipe with precise indications of quantity, brewing times and temperature levels are provided in the chapters that follow. Before starting to brew beer, we recommend that you gain an overview of the individual steps required for preparing a ready-to-drink beverage. To ensure that you do not miss any steps and to allow you to gain an overview of your brewing procedures in retrospect, we recommend keeping a brewing record (see Record in the attachment or go to [www.speidels-braumeister.de](http://www.speidels-braumeister.de/) ). Another tip: Allow yourself a day for your first brewing attempt, and where possible have another person join you, as it is much more fun together and another set of hands can be very helpful. Note that brewing beer requires a little experience and that each brewing process is an improvement on the previous one. So don’t be disappointed if your first beer does not quite meet your expectations. This is perhaps best illustrated by the words of a witty German poem that suggests that the beer from the first attempt is neither here nor there and is bound to cause flatulence, while the second is mediocre, causing you to pass more liquid than you consumed.

The third attempt results in a true beer enjoyed by

men and women alike (in German):

„Das erste Bier ist ein Plempel,

der den Bauern d´Hosen z´sprengt:

Andern zum Exempel.

Das zweite ist ein Mittelbier,

Trinkst drei Maß, so pieselst vier.

Das dritte ist ein Bier vom Kern,

das trinken d`Herrn und d´Frauen gern.“
