## Safety instructions {#safety-instructions}

*   The temperature of the container, lid, and add-on parts can become extremely high. Towards the end of the brewing process, the boiler contains boiling beer wort. Observe the installation instructions. Never move the Braumeister while it is hot. Always use pot holders or gloves when working on and with the Braumeister. **Risk of burning!**
*   When lifting the lid, ensure that the condensation on the underside of the lid flows back into the container. For this, hold the lid over the container at an angle. **Risk of scolding!**
*   The Braumeister consists nearly completely of stainless steel (electrically conductive).

For this reason, it may only be operated via a residual current circuit breaker 30 mA. Usually, a residual current circuit breaker already exists in the house installation. **Risk of electric shock!**

*   When performing cleaning activities on the Braumeister always ensure that the plug is disconnected (disconnection from mains). Do not spray the device down or allow spray to come into contact with electric components. **Danger of electric shock!**
*   Important: It is imperative that you secure the plug connections at the rear of the device (pump and heating) during operation of the device. Operating the device without securing plug and socket devices can lead to overheating. **Fire hazard!**
*   Please use the thermal sleeve available as an accessory for insulation. When using your own insulation ensure that the electronics and the lower part of the Braumeister are sufficiently ventilated, as a heat build-up and damage to the control may otherwise occur.
*   The pump must be vented prior to each use to prevent dry running. Venting takes place routinely in automatic operation. In the manual operation, the pump must be switched on and off several times until no more air bubbles escape.
