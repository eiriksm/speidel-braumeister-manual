# Brewing faults/troubleshooting {#brewing-faults-troubleshooting}

Do not repair the device yourself. Rather seek an authorised specialist. To avoid risks, defective controls/mains cables or other electrical components may only be replaced or repaired by the manufacturer, our customer service or a person with similar qualifications.

| **Problem when brewing:** | **Troubleshooting** |
| --- | --- |
| _Wort fountains shoot up during circulation_ | Malt is crushed too finely |
| _Pump blocked_ | More thorough insertion of fine sieve/filter cloth and filter plates. Take more care when pouring into malt pipe. No malt into vessel! |
| _Pump makes noises_ | Pump closed too tightly (hand tighten only) or not properly vented. |
| _Reaching correct temperature takes too long_ | Close lid during heating up period. |
| _Condensation forces its way out of the lid_ | Set up Braumeister in vertical position. |
| _Circulation process does not start_ | Check whether pump is operating and vented. |
| _Wort flows too slowly or not at all during purification_ | Use wooden spoon to pierce malt from top to bottom filter plate several times. Malt is crushed too finely -&gt; Break open corns only, do not grind finely. |

| **Problem with beer:** | **Troubleshooting** |
| --- | --- |
| _Beer smells and tastes sour_ | Ingress of bacteria: pour beer away. Work more thoroughly in cold-process area. Brewing times possibly not long enough, therefore excess starch residue in beer. |
| _Alcohol content too high_ | Decrease original wort content by adding water during the hops boiling process. |
| _Alcohol content too low_ | Increase original wort content by increasing boiling time (water evaporation). |
| _Various foreign odours_ | More cleanliness. |
| _Fermentation does not start_ | Add more yeast. |
| _Beer is cloudy_ | Store beer for longer period. |
| _Carbon dioxide too low_ | Too much carbon dioxide lost during decanting or through pipe. |
| _Carbon dioxide too low – beer foams over_ | Pressure too high – ventilate flip-top bottles more frequently. |
| _Poor foam stability_ | Too little carbon dioxide. |
| _Yield too low_ | Stir in malt more thoroughly |
